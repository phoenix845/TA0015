# 🌾 KrishiMitra AI - Project Overview

KrishiMitra AI is a comprehensive, modern web application designed to be an intelligent farming companion. It provides farmers with AI-powered insights, real-time data, and essential tools to improve crop yield and farm management.

## 🎯 Core Features

The application is built around several key features aimed at modernizing agricultural practices:
- **Crop Guidance:** AI-powered recommendations for selecting the best crops based on environmental factors.
- **Weather Integration:** Real-time weather updates and forecasts tailored to the user's location.
- **Market Prices:** Live tracking of agricultural market prices and trends.
- **Disease Detection:** AI-assisted identification of crop diseases.
- **Farmer Dashboard:** A centralized, analytics-driven dashboard to track farm health, yield estimates, and resource savings.
*(Note: A Marketplace and Edit Profile feature existed previously but were recently removed to streamline the core experience).*

## 💻 Technology Stack

KrishiMitra AI adopts a robust **MERN** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack architecture.

### Frontend (User Interface)
The frontend is a visually rich, responsive Single Page Application (SPA).
- **Framework:** React 19.2.4 with React Router v6 for navigation.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 3.3.6 for utility-first, responsive design, combined with custom CSS classes (e.g., emerald and sky color palettes).
- **Animations:** Framer Motion for smooth, premium UI transitions.
- **Data Visualization:** Recharts for dynamic charts and analytics on the dashboard.
- **State Management:** React Context API (specifically `AuthContext` for user sessions).
- **Other Tools:** Axios (HTTP client with JWT interceptors), React Hot Toast (notifications), React Icons.

### Backend (Server & API)
The backend provides a secure, RESTful API to support the frontend features.
- **Runtime:** Node.js with Express.js framework.
- **Database:** MongoDB (via MongoDB Atlas) using Mongoose ORM for data modeling.
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and bcryptjs for secure password hashing.
- **Security:** Helmet for HTTP header security, express-rate-limit to prevent brute-force attacks, and CORS.
- **File Management:** Multer for handling file uploads, and Cloudinary for cloud-based media storage (like profile/disease images).

## 🏗️ Architecture & Security

- **Authentication Flow:** Users must register and log in to access protected routes (like the Dashboard, Crop Guidance, etc.). The frontend securely stores the JWT token and attaches it to requests using Axios interceptors. The backend middleware validates this token before granting access.
- **Admin Roles:** The system supports Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Users with an `admin` role get access to an exclusive Admin Panel for platform management.
- **External APIs:** The backend likely integrates with external services like OpenWeatherAPI (based on existing environment variables) to fetch real-time data.

## 🚀 Setup & Deployment

### Environment Requirements
To run this project, the following environment variables are required:
- `MONGO_URI`: MongoDB connection string.
- `JWT_SECRET` / `JWT_EXPIRE`: For signing authentication tokens.
- `OPENWEATHER_KEY`: For fetching meteorological data.
- Cloudinary credentials (if image uploads are utilized).

### Running Locally
1. **Backend:** Navigate to `/backend`, run `npm install`, then start the development server using `npm run dev` (runs on port 5000).
2. **Frontend:** Navigate to `/frontend`, run `npm install`, then start the react app using `npm start` (runs on port 3000).
